~ <br>

You are not in a place; the place is in you. <br>

Angelus Silesius <br>
<br>

As I decay, or let the flames turn me to ashes, I will become dust and it me. Becoming a particle smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter. Wind and bees will carry me and spread me across this city, perhaps a butterfly will flutter its wings just enough so that I settle on some weeping fig in some corner. And by settling on that weeping fig and nothing more, my destiny; fulfilled. To be fulfilled by the lengths of the demands of the protagonist. }}}}}</p>
